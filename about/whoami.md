# `$whoami` 


> "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious."  
 _- Albert Einstein_  

At the risk of sounding too philosophical, I am but a passionately curious engineer by heart and soul. In pursuit of this curiosity, I have been exposed to a wide range of domains, platforms and technologies. As any driven engineer can relate, We are problem solvers. I enjoy applying myself to find simple solutions to complex problems while trying to stay outcome driven.
